# InstaFound
Instafound is a social network based on crowdfunding that uses NoSQL technologies such as MongoDB and Neo4J (cluster)

All the steps of the creation, from the idea to the justifications, up to its implementation are explained in the documentation "DocumentazioneProgetto.pdf". 
Some images in the documentation may be unclear. For this reason there are some images in the "UML" folder.

NB: This implementation includes code for connecting both locally and remotely with MongoDB and Neo4j. However the documentation refers only to the "remote" case.
